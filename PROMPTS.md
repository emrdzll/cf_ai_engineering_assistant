# AI Prompts Used in This Project

The following prompts were used with an AI assistant to build and customize this Cloudflare Workers AI application.

## 1. Initial Setup & Debugging
- "I am getting a 'jsonSchema not initialized' error in my Cloudflare worker. How can I fix this local development issue?"
- "How do I correctly set up the .dev.vars file for OpenAI API keys?"

## 2. Feature Implementation (Memory & Tools)
- "I want to add long-term memory to this agent using Cloudflare KV. Create 'saveToMemory' and 'getFromMemory' tools using the Workers KV binding."
- "Create a Todo List feature with 'addTodo' and 'listTodos' tools that persists data in KV storage."

## 3. UI/UX Customization
- "Customize the React frontend (app.tsx) to have a 'Space/Galaxy' theme using Tailwind CSS."
- "Add Framer Motion animations to make the chat messages slide in."
